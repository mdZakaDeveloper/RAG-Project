# 📚 Multi-PDF Chat 

Welcome to the **Multi-PDF Chat** — an intelligent chatbot that understands and interacts with multiple PDFs using LangChain, Google Gemini AI, FAISS vector database, and a beautifully crafted Streamlit interface. Ask questions and get accurate, real-time answers from your uploaded documents!

---

## 📝 Project Overview

This application allows users to upload one or more PDF files, automatically extracts and indexes the content, and enables smart Q\&A with the help of vector search and generative AI.

## 🧠 How It Works

![Architecture Diagram](assets/img/design.png)

1. **PDF Upload**: Users upload multiple PDFs via the app interface.
2. **Text Extraction**: Text is extracted from the PDFs using `PyPDF2`.
3. **Text Chunking**: Extracted text is split into manageable chunks using LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
4. **Embedding Generation**: Chunks are converted into embeddings using `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings`.
5. **Vector Storage**: Embeddings are stored in a local FAISS index.
6. **Similarity Search**: User questions are compared to the indexed content.
7. **Answer Generation**: Relevant chunks are passed to Gemini AI, which responds with accurate and context-aware answers.
